## 🔍 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Surrogate Model Platform, please help us protect our users by following responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email directly**: Send details to **durai@infinidatum.net**
2. **Subject line**: "Security Vulnerability - Surrogate Model Platform"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure after the fix is available

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- ✅ **Core Platform**: Backend API and ML algorithms
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT and user management systems
- ✅ **Database**: Data access and storage security
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All REST API security
- ✅ **Docker Images**: Container security
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Third-party package vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

The following are typically out of scope:
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Physical security issues
- ❌ Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- ❌ Issues in third-party services (GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.)
- ❌ Vulnerabilities requiring admin/root access

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying the Surrogate Model Platform:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication where available
   - Regularly rotate API keys and secrets

2. **Environment Security**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Use secure communication (HTTPS/TLS)
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Use secure database configurations

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Implement proper backup strategies
   - Follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)

4. **Access Control**:
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit user permissions
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Monitor access logs

### For Developers

When contributing to the project:

1. **Code Security**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Audit packages for vulnerabilities
   - Use package lock files
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies

3. **Testing**:
   - Include security test cases
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Test error handling

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens with configurable expiration
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented
3. **Input Validation**: API endpoints include input validation
4. **SQL Injection**: Protected via SQLAlchemy ORM
5. **CORS**: Configurable CORS settings
6. **Rate Limiting**: Recommended for production deployments

### Recommendations for Production

1. **SSL/TLS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Database Security**: Use encrypted connections and credentials
3. **Secret Management**: Use proper secret management systems
4. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. **Updates**: Keep all components updated regularly

## 🏢 Commercial Deployments

For commercial deployments requiring enhanced security:

- **Enterprise Support**: Contact **durai@infinidatum.net**
- **Security Audits**: Available for commercial customers
