### Limitations
- **Computationally expensive** - O(n³) scaling with dataset size
- **Memory intensive** for large datasets (> 10,000 samples)
- **Hyperparameter sensitive** - requires careful kernel selection
- **Limited to moderate dimensions** due to curse of dimensionality

### Best Use Cases
- Engineering design optimization with expensive simulations
